# Description

Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly where should I buy a 2 bedroom unit?

# Content & Acknowledgements

This data was scraped from publicly available results posted every week from Domain.com.au, I've cleaned it as best I can, now it's up to you to make data analysis magic. The dataset includes Address, Type of Real estate, Suburb, Method of Selling, Rooms, Price, Real Estate Agent, Date of Sale and distance from C.B.D.
